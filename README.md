Dataset: CIFAR10
Network of Comparison
- MLP
- CNN

Summary of Output:
- MLP: 42.6%
- CNN: 72.5%

Explanation: CNN is inherently a better network than MLP for learning images. Upon use of kernel, CNN can learn the spatial domain well, compared to MLP that learns the image on pixel array basis. A more in-depth analysis is contained in the iPython Notebook.
